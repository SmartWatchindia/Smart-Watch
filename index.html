                           <strong>
                              See why this new smartwatch is gaining popularity in <script>document.write(usergeo);</script>null and selling out everywhere...
                           </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>For a long time, the smartwatch industry had just a few big companies that could set any prices they wanted and kept ripping off customers. But now due to technlogical advancements and the cost of manufacuring is more frugal than earlier.</p>
                        <p>However, a  few companies have figured out a way to offer a far superior product (even the biggest tech geeks would agree) at a fraction of the price that is affordable to a larger chunk of people.</p>
                        <h2>What Is It?</h2>
                        <p><img src="./Why Are People Rushing To Get This Stylish New SmartWatch_ The Health Benefits Are Incredible_files/image_2020_11_02T11_45_03_149Z.jpg" caption="false" width="100%"></p>
                        <p>Meet this <strong>T55 SmartWatch</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>This SmartWatch combines the benefits of a fitness band,
                           digital watch, health monitor, and a handsfree headset
                           all into one!</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>It feels comfortable on your wrist.  Even better than some of the luxury smartwatches I own from other big tech companies.</p>
                        <p>Are you into Extreme workouts and outdoor sports? No problem, the hardened aluminum shell and tempered touchscreen glass won't scratch and is durable enough to withstand accidental falls.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, the T55 SmartWatch <strong>is the next generation of smartwatches.  </strong>.</p>

                        <p>The green laser behind the watch is the secret!</p>
                        <p>It is the heart rate monitoring function.</p>

                       <p>Most people till later in life don't know if <strong>they have a cardiac problem.</strong>. There might be mild symptoms but not make an impact on your daily life. It is necessary to recognise those at an early age so you don't face problems in the future. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           It is the leading cause of death for adults in <script>document.write(usergeo);</script>null. Even if you lead a healthy life style you could be at risk...
                        </p>
                        <div id="showbar"></div>

                        <h2>How Much Does this SmartWatch Cost?</h2>
                        <p>If you look at the features of the T55 SmartWatch it wouldn’t be surprising to see a price tag of up to Rs. 35000. Which would still be lower than most other Smart watches in the market like the Apple Watch is sold for Rs. 40,000 and up (some cost over Rs. 50,000).</p>
                        <p>That’s why we are stunned to share this watch with you that just costs <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;" class="discount">Rs. 2599</span> (on the date of publishing this article, the prices may change in future).</p>

                        <h2>How Can They Charge So Little?</h2>
                        <p>Since Wristmate Watch is a direct-to-consumer brand, they spend no money on advertising on Television or Hoardings.</p>
                        <p>They also only sell online so they can cut out any middle-men (like retailers) who just jack up the prices the consumer pays.</p>
                        <h2> Why Is It Discounted Right Now?</h2>
                        <p> It's very common these days that companies give a certain amount of customers a huge discount, on flash sales or new-launches but not everybody can claim the discount as a lot of people try to grab the discount offers and within minutes the products go out of stock</p>
